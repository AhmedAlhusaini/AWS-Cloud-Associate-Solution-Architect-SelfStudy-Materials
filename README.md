![I Start From Here With ALX](Assets/I%20start%20from%20Here%20With%20ALX.png)

Hello! I'm **Ahmed Tarek Alhusainy**, and this is my personal roadmap and resource hub for mastering the **AWS Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C03)** certification.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./Assets/ALX%20Accepting%20Panar.png" alt="ALX Acceptance Banner" width="600"/>
</p>

Welcome to the **AWS Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C03) Self-Study Guide**! 

This repository is a roadmap based on my successful completion of the AWS SAA certification through the **ALX Cloud Computing Program**, which started with the **Cloud Practitioner (CCP)** track , powered by **AWS Academy Cloud Architecting v3**.  

Whether you're just starting or deep into your cloud journey, this guide offers a structured, resource-rich path to mastering AWS architecture principles and passing the certification with confidence. 🚀

## 🧠 Why This Guide?

I created this README to:
- Share the exact resources I used to pass the **AWS SAA exam**
- Provide a **week-by-week breakdown** of the ALX program structure
- Offer a **modular study plan** aligned with the AWS Well-Architected Framework
- Help others **track progress**, **avoid overwhelm**, and **stay focused**

It serves as a structured roadmap for:
- 📘 Understanding course modules (M01–M17)  
- 🧩 Tracking hands-on labs and Well-Architected principles  
- 🔁 Applying study methods (SQ4R & Checkpoint Reflections)  
- 📂 Accessing official PDF guides and assets  
- 🚀 Connecting learning to real-world AWS architecture skills  


## ℹ️ Disclaimer

The materials in this guide are not all created by me but were collected through research and peers recommendation. My intention is not to claim ownership of any content but to provide a resource that can assist others in their cloud certification journey, just as it helped me. I hope this compilation of resources benefits everyone seeking to learn and grow in the field of cloud computing. 🎯

## 🚀 How to Use This Repo
1. Start with the **SQ4R** [Study Strategy](#-study-strategy-sq4r-method)
2. Follow the [Weekly Breakdown](#-weekly-structure-conceptual-view) for module pacing
3. Use the [Exam Kit](#-exam-preparation-kit) in your final 2 weeks
4. Explore [Arabic & English resources](#summary-of-study-materials-) based on your preference

## 📚 Study Strategy: SQ4R Method
**Don't Feel Overwhelmed! Use the SQ4R Study Strategy** , To maximize retention and clarity, I recommend using the **SQ4R** method firstly over the resources:

![Here You Will Find All Resources](Assets/Here%20You%20Will%20FInd%20All%20Resoucres.png) 

| Step      | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **S** – Survey   | Scan the material for structure and key ideas |
| **Q** – Question | Ask questions to guide your focus |
| **R** – Read     | Dive into the content actively |
| **R** – Recite   | Summarize in your own words |
| **R** – Review   | Revisit key concepts regularly |
| **R** – Reflect  | Connect new knowledge to existing understanding |

💡 **Tip:** After every module, draw a mini-architecture in Lucidchart or draw.io to visualize the service flow.

### **Summary of Study Materials 📚**
There is no *one ultimate resource* that fits all learners.  
Some prefer **Dion Training Notes**, others like **Stephane Maarek’s Udemy course**, and many blend different approaches.

For **Arabic native speakers**, I highly recommend keeping both:
- 🗣️ **Arabic Instructor sources** such as *Essia Abou Sharaf*, *Mohamed Rezk*, and other Arabic Udemy or YouTube creators.  
- 🌍 **English end-to-end courses** such as *Stephane Maarek’s top-rated Udemy SAA course*.

> 💡 My path: I studied with **Essia (DolfinED)** for Arabic clarity + **Stephane Maarek** for depth — alongside the official **ALX Program**.  
This balanced approach covered concept mastery and exam strategy effectively.

## 🧠 Exam Preparation Tips

- Review **Well-Architected Framework** pillars
- Practice with **scenario-based questions**
- Explore **ArabicChannels** and community notes if bilingual support helps
- Don’t memorize — understand the *why* behind each correct and incorrect answer.  
- Keep a “Weak-Topics” notebook to revisit after every mock test.  
- Use `/0_Summaries` each morning of your final three exam-prep days.  
- On exam day: stay calm, eliminate wrong options first, and trust your architecture logic.
